Adaptive and Performance based Energy Efficient Scheduling algorithm for Precedence constraint Parallel Task 

## Prerequisites

Inorder to run this script make sure to have Python 3.6 version or anyother version

## Data Input

Directed Acyclic Graph input is generated using [TGFF](http://ziyang.eecs.umich.edu/~dickrp/tgff/)

### ADAPTIVE ENERGY EFFICIENT SCHEDULING ALGORITHM

1) Open the file 'EnergyEfficientSchAlgo_AES.py'

2) If you are using Python 3.6, parameters must be configured in RUN environment using 'Configure per file'. 
The Parameters to be inputted include: 
a) FILE NAME: final.tgff 
b) MAXIMUM POWER: 100 (any values can be given)
c) MAKESPAN: 8 (values less than 10)

3) .tgff file is given as the input to this program

4) The program could be compiled and executed by RUN command

### PERFORMANCE ENERGY BALANCED DUPLICATION SCHEDULING ALGORITHM

1) Open the file 'EnergyEfficientSchAlgo_PEBD.py'

2) If you are using Python 3.6, parameters must be configured in RUN environment using 'Configure per file'. 
The Parameters to be inputted include: 
a) FILE NAME: final.tgff 
b) MAXIMUM POWER: 100 (any values can be given)
c) THRESHOLD: 8 (any values can be given)

3) .tgff file is given as the input to this program

4) The program could be compiled and executed by RUN command
